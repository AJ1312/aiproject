ðŸ”¥ðŸ’€ ACADEMIC ROAST - NO MERCY EDITION ðŸ’€ðŸ”¥

Alright, let's talk about this trainwreck:

ðŸ“Š Your "Stats" (if we can even call them that):
â€¢ CGPA: 8.44/10 (Congrats on the bare minimum flexibility)
â€¢ Internal Average: 32.6% (That's not a score, that's a cry for help)
â€¢ Strong Subjects: 0/7 (Yikes)
â€¢ Needs CPR: 7/7 subjects

ï¿½ THE BRUTAL TRUTH:
You got an 8.44 CGPA which is... fine I guess? But that 32.6% internal average? BRO. ðŸ’€

That's not academic performance, that's academic EXISTENCE. You're out here collecting grades like PokÃ©mon cards but forgetting to actually LEVEL UP.

7 subjects need attention? That's not a to-do list, that's a SURVIVAL GUIDE. You're basically the academic equivalent of "it runs but barely."

The way you're going, CAT2 isn't gonna test you - it's gonna ROAST you. And unlike me, it won't be funny.

ðŸŽ¯ Fix This Before It's Too Late:
1. Stop treating internals like optional side quests
2. Those 7 subjects? They need a RESURRECTION, not attention
3. Study like your degree depends on it (because it literally does)

Real talk: You got into VIT. That means you CAN do better. So stop playing games and START PLAYING TO WIN. The semester won't wait for your character development arc. 

Get it together. The FAT is coming and it's bringing CONSEQUENCES. ðŸ”¥
