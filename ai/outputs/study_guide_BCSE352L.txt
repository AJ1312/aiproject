Let's break down the marks:
*   **Current CAT1:** 9.6/15 (64%)
*   **Target Breakdown for 'A' (80 marks out of 100):**
    *   **CAT1:** 9.6/15 (already scored)
    *   **CAT2:** Aim for **13/15** (86.6%) - *Highly achievable with focused effort.*
    *   **Digital Assignment (DA):** Aim for **9/10** (90%) - *Start early, ensure quality and originality.*
    *   **Quiz 1:** Aim for **8/10** (80%) - *Focus on revising Units 1-2 thoroughly.*
    *   **Quiz 2:** Aim for **9/10** (90%) - *Solid understanding of Units 3-4 will ensure this.*
    *   **Internal Total (60 marks):** 9.6 + 13 + 9 + 8 + 9 = **48.6 / 60**
    *   **Remaining for FAT (40 marks):** To reach 80 total, you need 80 - 48.6 = **31.4 marks in FAT.**
    *   **FAT Percentage:** 31.4/40 = 78.5% - *A very strong performance in FAT, definitely achievable.*

**Steps to Achieve Target Grade 'A':**
1.  **Excel in CAT2 & Quizzes:** These are immediate opportunities to significantly boost your internal marks.
2.  **Max out DA:** Pay close attention to the DA requirements and aim for near-perfect.
3.  **Thorough FAT Prep:** Your strong internal score will reduce the pressure on FAT, but a solid 75-80% in FAT is crucial for an 'A'.

### 8. Time Management ‚è≥

*   **Recommended Hours/Week:** Dedicate **6-8 hours per week** to BCSE352L *outside* of class time.
*   **Distribution:**
    *   **60% (4-5 hours):** New content (Units 3, 4, 5) - Reading, understanding, note-taking.
    *   **30% (2 hours):** Practice and problem-solving - Working through examples, trying to apply concepts.
    *   **10% (1 hour):** Revision of previous units / catching up - Briefly review older concepts to keep them fresh.
*   **Consistency is Key:** Break down your study time into shorter, focused sessions (e.g., 2 hours on 3-4 days) rather than one long marathon session.

### 9. Exam Strategy (VIT Specific) üìù

*   **Understand Question Types:** VIT exams often feature:
    *   **Definitions/Explanations:** Clear, concise answers are key.
    *   **Comparisons/Distinctions:** Use tables or clear point-by-point differences.
