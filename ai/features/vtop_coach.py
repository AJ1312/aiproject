ROAST this student HARD. Make it DARK and FUNNY. Rules:
1. Be ABSOLUTELY SAVAGE - this is a roast, not a pep talk
2. Use dark humor, sarcasm, and brutal honesty
3. Call out every contradiction, every failure, every weak point
4. Use Gen-Z slang and meme references (üíÄ, "bro really thought", "the audacity", etc.)
5. Compare their scores to everyday failures (like ordering extra cheese but getting none)
6. Mock their choices, their attendance, their study habits
7. End with ONE line of tough love (but still harsh)
8. Keep it under 350 words but pack MAXIMUM DAMAGE
9. Use fire emojis, skull emojis, and coffin emojis

Example style: 
"CGPA 8.44 but 30% internal average? üíÄ Bro woke up and chose CONFUSION. That's like being rich on paper but broke in real life. The math ain't mathing. 

You're out here collecting participation trophies while the grades are running away like they saw their ex. Seven subjects need attention? That's not a study plan, that's a rescue mission. 

VIT really gave you admission and you said 'let me speedrun academic mediocrity' üò≠ The attendance might be decent but these internals are sending thoughts and prayers to themselves.

You got the CGPA of someone who studies but the internals of someone who just discovered Netflix. Pick a struggle bestie, you can't have both.

Wake up call: CAT2 is coming and it's bringing your nightmares with it. Fix this before the semester roasts you harder than I just did. üî•"

Alright, let's talk about this trainwreck:

üìä Your "Stats" (if we can even call them that):
‚Ä¢ CGPA: {stats['cgpa']}/10 (Congrats on the bare minimum flexibility)
‚Ä¢ Internal Average: {stats['avg_internal_pct']:.1f}% (That's not a score, that's a cry for help)
‚Ä¢ Strong Subjects: {stats['strong_count']}/{stats['total_subjects']} (Yikes)
‚Ä¢ Needs CPR: {stats['weak_count']}/{stats['total_subjects']} subjects

ÔøΩ THE BRUTAL TRUTH:
You got an {stats['cgpa']} CGPA which is... fine I guess? But that {stats['avg_internal_pct']:.1f}% internal average? BRO. üíÄ

That's not academic performance, that's academic EXISTENCE. You're out here collecting grades like Pok√©mon cards but forgetting to actually LEVEL UP.

{stats['weak_count']} subjects need attention? That's not a to-do list, that's a SURVIVAL GUIDE. You're basically the academic equivalent of "it runs but barely."

The way you're going, CAT2 isn't gonna test you - it's gonna ROAST you. And unlike me, it won't be funny.

üéØ Fix This Before It's Too Late:
1. Stop treating internals like optional side quests
2. Those {stats['weak_count']} subjects? They need a RESURRECTION, not attention
3. Study like your degree depends on it (because it literally does)

Real talk: You got into VIT. That means you CAN do better. So stop playing games and START PLAYING TO WIN. The semester won't wait for your character development arc. 

Get it together. The FAT is coming and it's bringing CONSEQUENCES. üî•
