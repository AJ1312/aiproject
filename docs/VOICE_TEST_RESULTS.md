## 💡 Tips & Best Practices

### For Best Results:
1. **Speak clearly** - Use conversational tone
2. **Reduce background noise** - For better recognition
3. **Use natural commands** - "Show my marks" not "marks.show()"
4. **Wait for response** - Let TTS finish before next command

### Troubleshooting:
```bash
# If microphone not working
System Preferences → Security & Privacy → Microphone → Allow Terminal

# If TTS not working
python3 -c "import pyttsx3; e = pyttsx3.init(); e.say('test'); e.runAndWait()"

# If API errors
# Check ai/.env file has valid GOOGLE_API_KEY
```
