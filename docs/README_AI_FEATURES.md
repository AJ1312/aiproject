# CLI-TOP AI Features - Fixed for Current Semester

## What Was Fixed

The AI features were using old cached or test data instead of fetching fresh, current semester data from VTOP. This has been completely fixed:

### Changes Made:
1. **Removed old cache builders**: Deleted `build_complete_cache.py` and `fetch_vtop_data.py` that were fetching outdated data
2. **Created current semester parser**: New `parse_current_semester.py` that extracts **Semester 5 (Fall 2025-26)** data from `/tmp/all_data.txt`
3. **Fixed data structure**: AI features now receive data in the correct format at root level
4. **Accurate predictions**: Grade predictions, attendance analysis, and CGPA calculations now work on current semester data

## Current Semester Data (Semester 5 - Fall 2025-26)

### Courses:
1. **Cloud Architecture Design** - CAT1: 64% (9.6/15)
2. **Advanced Competitive Coding - I** - CAT1: 90%, CAT2: 83.3%
3. **Artificial Intelligence** - CAT1: 90%, Quiz: 70%
4. **Database Systems** - CAT1: 70%, CAT2: 68%, Quiz: 70%
5. **Compiler Design** - CAT1: 50% ⚠️
6. **Malware Analysis** - CAT1: 80%
7. **Computer Networks** - CAT1: 59%

### Attendance (All Above 75%):
- Database Systems: 95% (34/36)
- AI: 95% (34/36)
- Compiler Design: 86% (30/35)
- Computer Networks: 92% (32/35)
- Malware Analysis: 88% (21/24)
- Cloud Architecture: 92% (33/36)
- Advanced Coding: 87% (31/36)

### Current CGPA: 8.41

## How to Use

### 1. Update Current Semester Data
```bash
# This parses /tmp/all_data.txt and creates current_semester_data.json
cd ai
python parse_current_semester.py
```

### 2. Run All AI Features (No API Key Required)
```bash
python run_all_features.py current_semester_data.json
```

**Features included:**
1. ✅ Attendance Buffer Calculator - Shows how many classes you can skip
2. ✅ Grade Predictor - Predicts FAT grades based on CAT/Quiz performance
3. ✅ CGPA Impact Analyzer - Shows impact of different grade scenarios
4. ✅ Attendance Recovery Planner - Plans for courses below 75%
5. ✅ Exam Readiness Scorer - Assesses preparation for upcoming exams
6. ✅ Study Time Allocator - Distributes 40 hours/week across courses
7. ✅ Performance Trend Analyzer - Analyzes attendance consistency
8. ✅ Grade Target Planner - Plans to reach target CGPA (e.g., 9.0)
9. ✅ Weakness Identifier - Identifies weak areas by subject

### 3. Run AI Chatbot (Requires Google Gemini API Key)
```bash
# Interactive chatbot with full VTOP context
python chatbot.py --data current_semester_data.json

# Or ask a single question
python chatbot.py --data current_semester_data.json --question "What should I focus on to improve my CGPA?"
```

### 4. Run Voice Assistant (Requires Google Gemini API + Speech Libraries)
```bash
python gemini_features/voice_assistant.py
```

**Voice commands:**
- "Can I leave classes?" - Checks attendance + provides advice
- "How am I doing?" - Performance overview with insights
- "What should I focus on?" - Identifies weak areas + study plan
- "Will I pass?" - Exam readiness + grade predictions
- "Show my marks" - Displays marks
- "Run all AI features" - Runs all 9 AI features

```

## API Key Setup (For Chatbot/Voice Features)

Create `ai/.env` file:
```bash
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
GEMINI_MODEL=gemini-2.0-flash-exp
```

Get API key from: https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey

## Key Insights from Current Data

### Strengths ✅
- Excellent attendance (all above 85%)
- Strong performance in AI (90% CAT1, 95% attendance)
- Advanced Competitive Coding is going well (90%, 83%)

### Areas Needing Attention ⚠️
1. **Compiler Design** (CAT1: 50%) - Weakest subject, needs immediate focus
2. **Computer Networks** (CAT1: 59%) - Below average, review fundamentals
3. **Database Systems** (CAT1: 70%, CAT2: 68%) - Moderate performance, can improve

### Target: 9.0 CGPA
- Need to score **A grades** (80%+) in all 7 courses
- Current trajectory: Mixed A/B grades → CGPA will stay ~8.41
- All S grades → CGPA can reach 8.67
- Focus on improving Compiler Design and Computer Networks

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "No attendance/marks data found"
**Solution**: Make sure you ran `parse_current_semester.py` first to create `current_semester_data.json`

### Issue: "GOOGLE_API_KEY not set"
**Solution**: Chatbot/Voice features require Gemini API. Set it in `ai/.env` or skip these features.

### Issue: Course names show truncated
**Solution**: Fixed in latest version of `parse_current_semester.py` - rerun the parser.

## Next Steps

1. ✅ **Update data regularly**: Run `parse_current_semester.py` after each CAT/quiz
2. 📊 **Monitor weak areas**: Check Compiler Design and Computer Networks weekly
3. 🎯 **Track CGPA progress**: Use CGPA Impact Analyzer before each FAT
4. 📚 **Follow study recommendations**: Allocate suggested hours to each course
5. 🤖 **Use chatbot for guidance**: Ask personalized questions about performance
